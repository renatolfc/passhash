        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>What good security practice demands:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Strong passwords that are hard to guess.</li>
          <li>Different passwords at each site.</li>
          <li>Periodically changing existing passwords.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why you probably aren't practicing good security:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Strong passwords are difficult to remember.</li>
          <li>Juggling a multitude of passwords is a pain.</li>
          <li>Updating passwords compounds the memorization problem.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How Quantum Hasher helps:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Strong passwords are automatically generated.</li>
          <li>The same master key produces different passwords at many
            sites.</li>
          <li>You can quickly upgrade passwords by "bumping" the site tag.</li>
          <li>You can upgrade the master key without updating all sites at
            once.</li>
          <li>It supports different length passwords.</li>
          <li>It supports special requirements, such as digit and punctuation
            characters.</li>
          <li>All data is saved to the browser's secure password database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Concepts</h2>

        <h3>Site Tag</h3>
        <p>
          A site tag is a simple name, e.g. "google" or "msn", assigned to a site and
          used to scramble the master key.  For light and medium security levels a
          default site tag is assigned and then provided whenever you return to the
          site.  The site tag just needs to be unique.  It does not need to be
          complex.
        </p>

        <h3>Master Key</h3>
        <p>
          A master key is a strong password you choose and use for many or all sites.
          Since site tags scramble the master key to create unique passwords, you
          only need more than one master key when you want to upgrade it for
          additional security.  At that point you begin updating passwords based on
          the new master key one site at a time.  You don't have to do them all at
          once.
        </p>

        <h3>Hash Word</h3>
        <p>
          A hash word is the result of scrambling the master key with a site tag.  It
          becomes the site password.  You give the master key to Quantum Hasher and
          it enters the hash word into the site's password field.
        </p>

        <h3>Using the Quantum Hasher</h3>
        <p>
          You can bring up the dialog in any one of the following ways.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Press the <strong>Control-F6</strong> key combination when in a password
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose <strong>Quantum Hasher</strong> from either the Tools menu or
            the browser toolbar button.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h1>

        <h2>Adjust the settings:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose <strong>Light</strong> security if your machine is isolated
            from other users.</li>
          <li>Choose <strong>Medium</strong> for normal use.</li>
          <li>Choose <strong>Heavy</strong> for high security, at the cost of
            extra typing, but not extra memorization.</li>
          <li>Check <strong>Password field markers</strong> if you want
            <img alt="[#]" src="../../skin/marker.png"/> markers next
            to password fields for simple access to the Quantum Hasher
            dialog.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Change a site password:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Access the site's password change area.</li>
          <li>Select each new password field.</li>
          <li>Bring up the Quantum Hasher one of the following ways:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Click on the <img alt="[#]"
                  src="../../skin/marker.png"/> marker if present.</li>
            <li>Press the <strong>Control-F6</strong> shortcut key combination.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Quantum Hasher</strong> from the right-click popup
              menu.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Quantum Hasher</strong> from the Tools menu.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Accept the automatically-generated site tag or provide your own.</li>
          <li>Press Tab.  The cursor moves to the Master Key field.</li>
          <li>Type a master key.</li>
          <li>Press Tab.  The dialog closes and injects the hash word into the
            password field.</li>
          <li>Submit the changes after all new password fields have been filled.</li>
          <li>The next time you log in follow a similar procedure to enter the new
            password at the login screen.</li>
          <li>Simply ignore the Quantum Hasher at sites using old passwords.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Security Levels</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Light</strong> maximizes convenience by guessing site tags,
            remembering entries, and revealing fields as plain text.  It is secure from
            remote hackers, but less secure from people with physical access to your
            machine and browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Medium</strong> improves protection by hiding the hash word and
            forcing you to re-enter the master key each time.  This is the default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heavy</strong> maximizes security by remembering nothing and hiding
            everything.  You must enter the site tag and master key each time and
            manually unmask fields to see their content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Custom</strong> allows you to specify individual security options.
            Tip - choose light, medium or heavy before selecting custom to start with a
            reasonable set of checked options.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Display Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Password field markers</strong> are small
            <img alt="[#]" src="../../skin/marker.png"/>
            symbols inserted next to password fields for one-click access to the
            Quantum Hasher dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Password unmasking markers</strong> are small
            <img alt="[*]" src="../../skin/unmask.png"/>
            symbols inserted next to password fields for one-click unmasking
            (revealing as plain text) of password fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Guess full domain</strong> causes guessed site tags to use the
            entire domain name, e.g. including ".com", ".org", etc., making it
            easier to have separate logins for sites sharing the same base name.
            It does result in longer site tags, when you have to type them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Default Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          These settings affect the default options for assuring generated hash words
          satisfy certain requirements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Digit</strong> forces hash words to have at least one digit
            character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Punctuation</strong> forces hash words to have at least one
            punctuation character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Both upper and lower-case letters</strong> forces hash words to
            have at least one of each case letter.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Default Size</h2>
        <p>
          This setting chooses the default hash word length, i.e. number of characters.
        </p>

            password field.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Requirement Options</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Punctuation</strong> force the hash word to have at least one
            punctuation character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mixed case</strong> force the hash word to have both upper and
            lower-case letters.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Restriction Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No special characters</strong> forces no punctuation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digits only</strong> forces only digits.
          </ul>
          <h2>Size Options</h2>
          <p>
            Choose a custom hash word length for this site.
          </p>
          <h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Enter</strong> takes you to the next empty field and finally closes
              the dialog and injects the hash word when done.  This is generally the
              only navigation key you need, and should be far easier than using a mouse.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Esc</strong> immediately closes the dialog without injecting the
              hash word.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Frequently-Asked Questions:</h2>

          <h3>Am I really improving my security or just saving effort?</h3>
          <p>
            It depends.  It should improve the security of most users by easing the
            burden of using strong and varied passwords.  On the other hand, if you are
            highly disciplined and aware of security needs you may actually increase
            your vulnerability by exposing more sites to intrusion if a master key is
            stolen.  Of course the hacker will only be successful if he knows to use
            this tool to regenerate hash words.  If you're reusing passwords already
            this tool should only help.
          </p>

          <h3>What if I need to log in and this tool isn't available?</h3>
          <p>
            You can generate a Portable Page to load and run in any browser when this
            extension is unavailable.  You can also use the
            <a href="http://wijjo.com/passhash/passhash.html" target="_content">
              online tool</a> to generate identical hash words, but it won't know your
            site tags and settings.  See the <a href="portable.html">Portable</a> help
            page for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The page fits nicely in a Firefox sidebar for extra convenience.  It is
            also completely self-contained, so you can move the one HTML file to other
            storage devices, including USB keys.  page as a single self-contained file
            and store it on a USB key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be aware that the extra hash word filtering and size options make
            this tool incompatible with other similar tools, e.g.
            <a href=http://hashapass.com/ target="_content">Hashapass</a>, which may
            generate different results, depending on which options your are using.
          </p>

          <h3>Should I record the generated hash words somewhere?</h3>
          <p>
            It's not a bad idea, but if you save a Portable Page as backup you have
            everything but the master key(s).  So it's up to you.  An additional
            locked-up "dead tree" or electronic copy is an extra measure of safety, in
            case you need to manually enter the hash words someday.  You can also use a
            program like <a href="http://keepass.sourceforge.net" target="_content">
              KeePass</a> (highly recommended for Windows users) to save your data in an
            encrypted file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just give a bit of thought to all the scenarios of dying or borrowed
            computers and broken software. :)
          </p>

          <h3>Do I have to remember the options set for each site?</h3>
          <p>
            Not normally.  The tool remembers it for you.  But if you lose the saved
            data, e.g. by clearing the Firefox password cache, you need to reproduce
            the default settings and the overrides for individual sites.  Hopefully you
            won't have so many special cases that remembering is a problem.
          </p>

          <h3>Where is the data stored?</h3>
          <p>
            Everything is stored in the Firefox password cache.  It's encrypted and
            secure.  You can use extensions like the
            <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2848" target="_content">
              Password Exporter</a> to save this cached data for backup or to transfer
            it to another machine.
